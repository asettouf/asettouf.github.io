I am a Java developer, interested in every area of computer sciences,
from the computer graphics to the network security. I am as well really interested
in a wide variety of topics including philosophy, social networking, and analytics.
I love to learn new skills and I believe in the *Do It Yourself philosophy* to acquire knowledge.
